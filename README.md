# üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Home Lab

A hands-on cybersecurity home lab built for SOC analyst training, threat detection, and offensive/defensive testing using Proxmox, Security Onion, Kali Linux, Pi-hole, and more. This project documents the design, setup, and use of a home lab environment to simulate real-world cyber scenarios and sharpen technical skills.

## üìå Objectives

- Simulate a small-scale Security Operations Center (SOC)
- Monitor, detect, and respond to network threats
- Practice ethical hacking in a safe, isolated environment
- Build hands-on experience with common security tools
- Learn how systems, networks, and logs interact
